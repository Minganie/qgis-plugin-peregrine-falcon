# qgis-plugin-peregrine-falcon
A QGIS plugin to automatically detect favorable peregrine falcon habitat based on topography maps

## Scope
This plugin was made as part of a class project. It is a simple script, but could easily be adapted to take more or different parameters into account, to better detect likely habitat or be adapted for a different species.
